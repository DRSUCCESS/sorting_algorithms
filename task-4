4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence

Prototype: void shell_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must use the following sequence of intervals (a.k.a the Knuth sequence):
n+1 = n * 3 + 1
1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...
Youâ€™re expected to print the array each time you decrease the interval (See example below).
No big O notations of the time complexity of the Shell sort (Knuth sequence) algorithm needed - as the complexity is dependent on the size of array and gap
