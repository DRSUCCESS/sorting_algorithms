Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm

Prototype: void counting_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
Youâ€™re expected to print your counting array once it is set up (See example below)
This array is of size k + 1 where k is the largest number in array
Write in the file 102-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Counting sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
