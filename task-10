10. Bitonic sort
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm

Prototype: void bitonic_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You can assume that size will be equal to 2^k, where k >= 0 (when array is not NULL …)
You are allowed to use printf
You’re expected to print the array each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Output: see example
Write in the file 106-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bitonic sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
