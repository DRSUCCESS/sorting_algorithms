#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

Prototype: void quick_sort_hoare(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the Hoare partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 107-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
