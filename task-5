Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm

Prototype: void cocktail_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
Youâ€™re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 101-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
